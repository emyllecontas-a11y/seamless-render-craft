## UI architecture
- Keep shared visual tokens and library-card treatment in src/styles.css and shared navigation in AppShell so all mock screens inherit one consistent theme.
- Preserve mock data and interaction handlers during visual redesigns; presentation changes must not introduce real persistence or services.
